HR Data Analysis - Performance and Absenteeism

Project Overview: This project analyzes a Human Resources dataset to identify the main factors affecting employee performance and absence rates. It uses statistical methods to provide clear insights for workforce management.

Key Steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset structure.

Statistical testing using the Chi-Square method to check the link between Gender and Performance.

Outlier detection using the Interquartile Range (IQR) to find abnormal absence patterns.

Data visualization to compare employee productivity with absenteeism.

Main Findings:

Statistical analysis helps detect potential biases in performance reviews.

Identification of specific employee groups with high absence risks.

Technologies:

Python (Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
